**Status**: approved — all 10 milestones delivered
**Task ID**: TASK-030
**Version Target**: v2.3.0

## 1. Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Every job application currently costs 2 cloud LLM API calls (resume + cover letter). For users applying to 50+ similar roles, this is expensive (~$0.10-0.50/application) and redundant — the same experience bullets get regenerated from scratch each time.

### Who has this problem?
Job seekers using AutoApply in automated mode who apply to many similar positions (e.g., 20 "Backend Engineer" roles in one week).

### How big is this problem?
- At 50 applications/day × $0.20/app = $10/day = $300/month in API costs
- Each generation takes 10-30s latency, slowing the bot loop
- Users must manually maintain .txt experience files with no structure
- No way to learn which resume content leads to interviews

### How is it solved today?
- LLM generates fresh resume per application (expensive, slow)
- Users manually write .txt experience files (unstructured, error-prone)
- Fallback templates used when no API key configured (poor quality)
- No feedback loop — system doesn't learn from outcomes

## 2. User Personas

| Persona | Description | Key Need | Pain Point | Frequency |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Active Seeker | Job seeker running bot daily, 20-50 apps/day | Reduce API costs while maintaining quality | $10+/day in API calls, slow generation | Daily |
| Career Switcher | Professional with diverse experience | Relevant resume for each job type | Manual .txt files don't adapt well | Weekly |
| Power User | Technical user who wants control | Fine-tune which bullets appear on resume | No visibility into what LLM selects | Ongoing |
| New User | First-time AutoApply user with existing resume files | Seamless onboarding without manual data entry | Existing .txt/.md files not automatically imported | One-time |

### Acceptance Criteria

#### US-101: Document Upload & Extraction (M1)
- Given a PDF/DOCX/TXT/MD file, When uploaded, Then text is extracted and sent to LLM once
- Given LLM response, When parsed, Then categorized entries are stored in KB with dedup

#### US-105: Automatic Scoring (M2)
- Given a JD and KB entries, When scored, Then entries ranked by TF-IDF cosine similarity
- Given synonym aliases exist, When "python3" appears in JD, Then "Python" entries score higher

#### US-108: PDF Rendering (M3→M4, superseded)
- Given LLM-structured resume content, When rendered via ReportLab, Then a valid PDF is produced
- Given KB entries selected by LLM, When assembled, Then only KB data appears in the output (strict constraint)

#### US-111: KB-First Bot Flow (M4)
- Given a JD and populated KB, When bot generates docs, Then KB assembly is tried first
- Given insufficient KB entries, When assembly fails, Then system falls through to LLM generation
- Given LLM generates a resume, When generation completes, Then output is ingested into KB

#### US-135: Dashboard Automation Toggles (M4)
- Given the Dashboard is shown, When loaded, Then "Adaptive Resume" checkbox reflects `resume_reuse.enabled` config
- Given the Dashboard is shown, When loaded, Then "Cover Letter" checkbox reflects `bot.cover_letter_enabled` config
- Given user toggles Adaptive Resume off, When toggled, Then PUT /api/config saves immediately (no Save button needed)
- Given Adaptive Resume is off, When bot generates docs, Then `fallback_resume_path` is used instead of KB assembly
- Given Cover Letter is off, When bot generates docs, Then LLM cover letter generation is skipped entirely

#### US-136: Default Resume Upload (M4)
- Given Dashboard upload control, When no file uploaded, Then display shows "None"
- Given a PDF/DOCX file up to 5 MB, When POST /api/config/default-resume, Then file saved to ~/.autoapply/default_resume.{ext}
- Given file uploaded, When config updated, Then `fallback_resume_path` points to saved file
- Given GET /api/config/default-resume, When called, Then returns current filename
- Given DELETE /api/config/default-resume, When called, Then file removed and config cleared
- Given a file is uploaded, When displayed, Then a Remove (X) button is visible

#### US-137: KB Page UI Improvements (M4)
- Given the KB page, When displayed, Then layout order is: Stats → ATS + Smart Resume Assembly → Resume Builder + Documents → KB Entries
- Given the upload control, When KB page displayed, Then upload is inside "Uploaded Documents" card
- Given the KB page, When displayed, Then Resume Templates section is removed (LaTeX deprecated)
- Given preview popup, When opened, Then it covers full viewport with dark overlay, Close and Download buttons

#### US-115: KB Viewer & Editor (M5)
- Given KB entries exist, When user opens KB viewer, Then all entries shown with category/text/tags
- Given an entry, When user edits text or tags, Then changes are persisted immediately

#### US-118: ATS Compatibility (M6)
- Given a JD and KB entries, When ATS score requested, Then composite score (0-100) returned
- Given missing keywords, When gap analysis run, Then missing keywords/skills/sections listed

#### US-121: Manual Builder (M7)
- Given KB entries displayed, When user drags entry to resume section, Then entry appears in that section
- Given a built resume, When user clicks save preset, Then preset saved with name and entry IDs

#### US-125: PDF Cache (M8)
- Given identical resume content, When rendered twice, Then second render returns cached PDF
- Given cache exceeds 200 entries, When new entry added, Then oldest entry evicted (LRU)

#### US-128: Outcome Feedback (M9)
- Given an application, When user provides "interview" outcome, Then effectiveness_score recalculated
- Given entries with high effectiveness, When scoring, Then TF-IDF blended with effectiveness (70/30)

#### US-132: Auto-Migration (M10)
- Given .txt files in profile/experiences/, When first startup, Then lines parsed as KB entries
- Given migration already completed, When startup, Then migration skipped (marker file check)

- Cover letter PDF templates (CL uses text-only assembly)

---

## 6. Prioritization (MoSCoW — Full Feature)

- **Must have** (P0, 60%): Document upload + extraction, KB CRUD, TF-IDF scoring, LLM-powered resume assembly with strict KB-only constraints, ReportLab PDF rendering, KB-first bot flow, KB viewer UI, ATS scoring, auto-migration — *the core value proposition*
- **Should have** (P1, 30%): Manual builder, presets, PDF cache, JD classifier, outcome learning, effectiveness weighting, cover letter assembly — *significant quality-of-life improvements*
- **Could have** (P2, 10%): ONNX embeddings, reuse stats analytics, config fine-tuning — *nice-to-have for power users*
- **Won't have**: Cloud sync, multi-user, OCR, custom template editor — *future features*

---

## 7. Constraints
- Must use SQLite (existing DB layer, no new infrastructure)
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing config.json
- LLM extraction must work with all 4 supported providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek)
- New dependencies must be pinned versions
- ReportLab is the primary PDF renderer (no LaTeX/pdflatex dependency)
- All user-facing strings must go through i18n (t() backend, data-i18n frontend)
- All UI components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|:-----------:|:------:|-----------|--------|
| LLM extraction produces bad JSON | M | M | Robust parsing with fallback, validation | Resolved — json.loads with fence stripping |
| PyPDF2 can't extract from scanned PDFs | M | L | Log warning, user can re-upload as TXT | Accepted |
| Dedup too aggressive (different contexts) | L | M | Dedup on (category, text) — subsection differs OK | Resolved |
| TF-IDF misses semantic similarity | M | M | ONNX embedding blending (optional), synonym normalization | Mitigated — synonym map + tech terms |
| ~~LaTeX compilation fails on edge cases~~ | ~~L~~ | ~~M~~ | ~~ReportLab fallback, escape_latex()~~ | Eliminated — LaTeX removed; ReportLab is primary renderer |
| KB pollution from low-quality LLM output | L | M | Dedup constraint, min_score threshold during assembly | Mitigated |
| Async upload thread leaks | L | H | Daemon threads, threading.Lock, finally cleanup | Resolved |

## 9. Open Questions

| # | Question | Needed By | Status |
|---|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | ONNX embedding model size acceptable for distribution? | M2 | Resolved — ONNX is optional, TF-IDF is default. Stub interface ready for future implementation. |
| 2 | ~~TinyTeX bundle size for Electron packaging?~~ | ~~M3~~ | Eliminated — LaTeX pipeline superseded; ReportLab (pure Python) has no external binary dependency. |
| 3 | Should effectiveness_score decay over time? | M9 | Open — currently uses all-time ratio. Could add recency weighting in future. |
